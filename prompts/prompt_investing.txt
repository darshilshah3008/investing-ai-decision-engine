PROMPT START
I want you to analyze the stocks that I currently hold using the data I have provided in the uploaded documents:
•	watchlist_snapshot.csv 
•	final_screened_with_research.csv
•	sec_revenue_screened_with_pe.csv
•	sec_revenue_screened.csv
•	sec_all_tickers.csv
Your task:
________________________________________
1. CLARITY — TASK
Explain in simple terms:
•	Which stocks I currently own (identify tickers from documents).
•	For each stock, whether the 1–5 year outlook suggests Buy, Hold, or Sell.
•	Use only data from my documents + market logic (no hallucinations).
•	Make assumptions ONLY if they are required, and state them.
________________________________________
2. CONTEXT — BACKGROUND
Use this context:
•	Purpose: I want actionable long-term investment guidance
•	Audience: Non-expert investor
•	Prior Knowledge: Basic understanding of stocks
•	Use Case: Building a 1–5 year portfolio strategy

3. FORMAT — STRUCTURE
Present your analysis using:
•	Bullet points
•	Tables
•	Short summaries per stock
•	ASCII diagrams (if it helps explain valuation or trend)
For each stock include:
A. Snapshot
•	Ticker
•	Sector
•	Revenue trend
•	PE information
•	Growth flags (positive/negative)
•	Any red/yellow/green signals
B. Rating
Choose one based on evidence:
•	BUY → undervalued, strong growth drivers
•	HOLD → fairly valued, steady
•	SELL → overvalued, declining fundamentals, red flags
C. 1–5 YEAR OUTLOOK
Use bullet points:
•	Catalysts
•	Risks
•	Expected trend (↑, →, ↓)

4. EXAMPLES — GOOD & BAD
Follow the GOOD format:
•	Clear explanation
•	Visual table
•	Simple diagrams
•	Real-world analogy if useful
Avoid BAD format:
•	Large paragraphs
•	Vague statements
•	Unsupported claims
•	Missing reasoning
________________________________________
5. TONE / VOICE
•	Tone: clear, helpful, direct
•	Voice: analytical but simple, like a finance tutor explaining step-by-step
________________________________________
6. CHAIN OF THOUGHT
Explain reasoning in a teaching style, but DO NOT reveal internal chain-of-thought.
Provide only structured, external explanation.

7. CONSTRAINTS — RULES
•	Max 1–2 compact sections per stock
•	Include:
o	definitions (e.g., PE, revenue growth)

o	unnecessary theory
Priority: Clarity → Accuracy → Format → Tone
